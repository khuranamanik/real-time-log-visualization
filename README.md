Real-Time Log Visualization using DevOps

## Abstract
In this rapidly developing world, an ample amount of professionalism is required in every work environment. Therefore, software developers do not have enough time for everything that they are supposed to do. Earlier a simple task used to take weeks to be completed and now it happens in mere seconds. With this project, we aim to present a software solution with the assistance of the latest tools used in agile environments like DevOps and reduce the amount of time and effort to view the logs of any particular server. Crucial details of the server will be taken care of by the Elastic Stack collectively. The ELK stack will be up and running with the help of an ansible-playbook. This project will be done using only an ansible-playbook. This task, if not done this way, requires a lot of work to be done each and every time.
